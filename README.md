### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Catalin from Romania. I am a creative and persistent entrepreneur who built two profitable businesses in the last five years, developing a real passion for reading and learning new useful skills every day. 

Currently on a beautiful journey to a career as a Front-End Developer/Software Engineer. 

Autonomous and a proficient learner, I am constantly
practicing JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Angular and React, learning from mistakes and improving my programming skills to thrive in this field.
