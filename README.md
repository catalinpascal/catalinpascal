I am a creative and persistent entrepreneur who built two profitable businesses in the last five years, developing a real passion for reading and learning new useful skills every day.

Currently on a beautiful journey to a career as a Front-End Developer/Software Engineer.

Autonomous and a proficient learner, I am constantly practicing JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Angular and React, learning from mistakes and improving my programming skills to thrive in this field.

Skills: JS / HTML / CSS / ANGULAR / REACT

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on cool projects to practice my skills, increasing the complexity and quality. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more JavaScript! And then some more. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Once I've blocked my PC iterating a for loop ... for forever.
